'''Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets. '''

myTuple = ('a', 'b', 'c')
print(myTuple)

print(myTuple[0])

''' - Declared with parentheses
    - Are ordered and subscriptable
    - Cannot be modified '''
